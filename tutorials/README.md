# Tanoa
---
 
Tanoa can both create sample peak regions and call peaks from a fragment_depth file. The following tutorials 
will discuss how Tanoa does this, it's strengths and weaknesses and how to use Tanoa. 

Usage:

   1. [Installing Tanoa](../blob/dev/tutorials/installing-tanoa.md)
   2. [Tanoa call peaks](../blob/dev/tutorials/call-peaks.md)
   3. [Tanoa generate peaks](../blob/dev/tutorials/generate-peaks.md)

Documentation:

   [Algorithm](TanoaPeakSimulator/blob/dev/docs/algorithm.md)

Tanoa's strengths and weakness are discussed along with the algorithm in that document.
