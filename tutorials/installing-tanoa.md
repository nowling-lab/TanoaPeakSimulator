# Tanoa
---

To install tanoa there are a few steps to follow:

    1. Install and run a python virtual environment (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
    2. Clone the tanoa repo with git
    3. Change directory into the repo and run: "python3 setup.py install"

Tanoa only uses default Python libraries and does not require any other libraries to be installed to run

After those steps, tanoa can be run by using the generate peaks command, or the tanoa call peaks command.
